Signals and Systems: GNU Octave Tutorial Series
===============================================

Overview
--------
This repository provides a 10-session tutorial series designed for undergraduate students enrolled in a Signals and Systems course. The goal is to integrate theoretical foundations with practical exercises using GNU Octave, enabling students to visualize and simulate signal behaviors and system responses.

Learning Objectives
-------------------
- Understand and visualize signal properties using GNU Octave.
- Simulate basic signal and system operations (convolution, system response).
- Apply Fourier and Laplace transforms in Octave for analysis.
- Learn sampling and reconstruction through visualization.
- Complete a mini project involving real-world signal/system simulation.

Getting Started
