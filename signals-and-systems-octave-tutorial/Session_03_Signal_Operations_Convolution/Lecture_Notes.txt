Session 3: Signal Operations and Convolution

1. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Understand basic signal operations.
   - Learn convolution operation and its significance in signal processing.
   - Perform convolution manually and using Octave functions.

2. **Theory Content**:
   - **Basic Operations on Signals**:
     - Addition: y[n] = x1[n] + x2[n]
     - Multiplication: y[n] = x1[n] * x2[n]
     - Scaling: y[n] = a * x[n]
   - **Convolution**:
     - Definition: y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = Î£ x[k] * h[n-k]
     - Graphical interpretation
     - Properties of convolution: commutative, associative, distributive

3. **Applications of Convolution**:
   - System response to input signal
   - Filtering

4. **Visualization and Practical Examples in Octave**
