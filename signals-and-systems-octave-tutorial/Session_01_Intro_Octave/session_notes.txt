Session 1: Introduction to GNU Octave and Its Environment
=========================================================

Learning Objectives:
- Learn how to navigate the Octave interface.
- Understand how vectors and matrices are handled.
- Generate and visualize basic signals like unit step, impulse, and ramp.

Topics Covered:
- Octave environment (command window, editor, workspace)
- Vectors and matrix operations
- Basic plotting commands: plot(), stem(), title(), xlabel(), ylabel()
- Signal generation using built-in or custom functions

Instructions:
1. Open GNU Octave and load the `exercises.m` file for this session.
2. Read the comments in the script and run the code line by line.
3. Try modifying parameters to see how signals behave differently.
