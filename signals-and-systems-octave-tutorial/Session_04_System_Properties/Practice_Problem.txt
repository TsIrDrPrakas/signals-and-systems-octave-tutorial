3. Practice Problems and Tasks

A. Classification Tasks
For each of the following systems, determine whether the system is:
- Linear or Non-linear
- Time-invariant or Time-variant
- Causal or Non-causal
- Stable or Unstable
- Memoryless or Not
	a. y[n] = 3x[n]
	b. y[n] = x[n] + 2x[n−1]
	c. y[n] = n·x[n]
	d. y[n] = x[n+1]
	e. y[n] = x[n]^2

B. Octave Tasks
1. Implement each of the systems (a–e) in Octave for x[n] = sin(0.2πn), n = 0 to 20.
2. Plot the input and output signals.
3. Verify stability by checking if the output remains bounded when input is bounded.
